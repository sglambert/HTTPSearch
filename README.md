# HTTPSearch Repository
The code in this repository is based around making HTTP requests to websites and then sending information from the requests to users

My partner likes to purchase clothes on a second hand clothing website. Unfortunately, the website does not have functionality to set email alerts when someone has posted something you are looking for. Therefore, I'm creating this little script to make HTTP get requests to the site. I'll then perform execute several regular expressions on the results to find what I want. Finally, any results will be emailed to the user (in this case my partner!). 

I would like firstly have this setup for her, but then try and generalise it so it can possibly work on other websites.
